<h1 align="center">  Play/Sing Guitar Pro Files </h1>

My friend sings like shit, we tried some software that showed the songs notes in comparison with his vocal notes but the software lacked a lot of songs we liked to play, so i made this python project that gets a guitar pro file and the mic input and compares the notes frequency played.

Right now is in a very early stage of development and lacks a lot of features but i will update it adding new and future features and images/videos in this README.
